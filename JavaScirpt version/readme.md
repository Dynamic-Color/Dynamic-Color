# Dynamic-Color-JavaScript

This is a frontend code implementation library based on d3.js. We place related dependencies in the same folder, with the main file being generator.js, which can be used as a module.
Due to considerations of time efficiency, we recommend utilizing the C++/Python versions.

**The current portion of the code is being debugged and organized, and we anticipate it will be online within one week(<0508).** 
**We apologize for any inconvenience.**
