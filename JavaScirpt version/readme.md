# Dynamic-Color-JavaScript

This is a front-end code implementation library based on d3.js. We place relevant dependencies in the same folder, with the main file being generator.js, which can serve as a primary module.
Due to considerations of time efficiency, we recommend utilizing the C++/Python versions.

**The current portion of the code is being debugged and organized, and we anticipate it will be online within one week.**
**We apologize for any inconvenience.**
